**XMediusSENDSECURE (SendSecure)** is a collaborative file exchange platform that is both highly secure and simple to use.
It is expressly designed to allow for the secured exchange of sensitive documents via virtual SafeBoxes.

SendSecure comes with a **Web API**, which is **RESTful**, uses **HTTPs** and returns **JSON**.

Specific libraries have been published for various languages:
[C#](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-csharp),
[Java](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-java),
**JavaScript**,
[PHP](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-php),
[Python](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-python)
and
[Ruby](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-ruby).

# Quick Start

## Authentication (Retrieving API Token)

Authentication is done using an API Token, which must be first obtained based on SendSecure enterprise account and user credentials.
Here is the minimum code to get such a user-based API Token.

```javascript
SendSecure.Client.getUserToken('deathstar', 'darthvader', 'd@Rk$1De', 'deviceid', 'deviceName', 'theApplicationType', 'https://portal.integration.xmedius.com')
  .then( token => console.log(token))
  .catch(e => { throw error; })


SendSecure.Client.getUserToken('deathstar', 'darthvader', 'd@Rk$1De')
  .then(userToken => {
                console.log(userToken);
});
```

## SafeBox Creation

Here is the minimum required code to create a SafeBox â€“ with 1 recipient, a subject, a message and 1 attachment.
This example uses the user's *default* security profile (which requires to be set in the account).

### With SafeBox Helper Class

```javascript
var inputElement = document.getElementById("input");
inputElement.addEventListener("change", function(){
  var file = this.files[0]; /* now you can work with the file list */

SendSecure.Client.getUserToken('acme', 'bonjour', 'Qwerty123', 'https://portal.integration.xmedius.com')
  .then(result => {
    let safebox = new SendSecure.Helpers.Safebox('mail@mail.com')
    let recipient = new SendSecure.Helpers.Recipient( {email: 'allan.seymour@xmedius.com', first_name: 'Allan', last_name: 'Seymour'} );
    let contactMethod = new SendSecure.Helpers.ContactMethod();
    contactMethod.destinationType = 'cell_phone'
    contactMethod.destination =  '+15145550000'
    recipient.contactMethods = [ contactMethod ];
    //let securityProfile = new SendSecure.Helpers.SecurityProfile
    safebox.subject = 'Hello World';
    safebox.message = 'This is an Hello World Message';
    safebox.recipients = [ recipient ]
    safebox.attachments = [ new SendSecure.Helpers.Attachment(file)];
    let client = new  SendSecure.Client(result, 'acme', "https://portal.integration.xmedius.com");
    return client.submitSafebox(safebox)
  })
  .then(e => console.log(e))
  .catch(e => console.log(e))
})
```
